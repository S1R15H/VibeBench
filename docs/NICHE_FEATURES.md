**Implementation:**
- Cost tracking per API call (tokens × price)
- Quality scoring (1-100) based on compilation, security, correctness
- ROI metrics: Quality Points Per Dollar, Cost-Adjusted Ranking
- TCO analysis: API + infrastructure + developer overhead

**Metrics:**
- `/query`: $/successful_code_generation
- `Quality-per-Dollar`: (Correctness Score) / (Cost in $)
- `Time-to-Value`: (Execution Time) / (Cost in $) = efficiency
- `Cost Rank`: Rank by cost across all models

**Business Value:**
- Capture cost-conscious SME market
- Become go-to for budget justification in procurement
